# Open elevation data project

The goal of this project is to maintain the most up-to-date resource for freely available elevation data worldwide (DEM = Digital Elevation Model).

Most countries in the world do not provide good elevation data (resolutions < 30m) free of charge, but for often horrendous cost. There're exceptions, e.g. Switzerland providing great quality DEMs with 0.5m resolution since 2021.

The first step in this project is to collect the best resources available, preferably with direct download links.

The next step would be to generate freely available elevation maps and hillshade models for single countries or the whole world, and to provide scripts and tools to help you process the data on your own.

## CONTRIBUTE!

If you know good sources of elevation data, please provide the information ideally by creating a pull request or through an issue.

Feel free to add your country to the list!
